/**
* \mainpage The Meego Resource Policy Qt API: Libresourceqt
*
* \section intro_section Introduction
*
* This library is used to request resources from the Meego Policy Resource Manager,
* by means of two classes: \ref ResourcePolicy::Resource and
* \ref ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet.
*
* The Libresourceqt API provides:
*
* <table>
* <caption>
*   <big><b>
*     Classes in Libresourceqt API
*   </b></big>
* </caption>
* <tr>
*   <th>Name</th>
*   <th>Content</th>
* </tr>
* <tr>
*   <td>ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet</td>
*   <td>The \ref ResourceSet is the main class whose instances should be filled with resources needed by the application.
*       Then use the ResourceSet's methods to acquire those resources. </td>
* <tr>
*   <td>ResourcePolicy::Resource</td>
*   <td>The ResourceSet is filled with instances of subclasses of the class \ref Resource, for example AudioResource.</td>
* </tr>
* </table>
*
* \section library_started_section Getting started
*
* Say that your application is a player (if not a player than use another suitable application class,
* please see "Further Information" section), then in order to use the Resource Policy Library, you first need to create the
* \ref ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet like this:
* \code
* ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet* mySet = new ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet("player");
* \endcode
* Then to add resources to the set, use the ResourceSet::addResource() method like this:
* \code
* mySet->addResource(AudioPlaybackType);
* mySet->addResource(VideoPlaybackType);
* \endcode
* If you want to pre-populate the AudioResource with the audio group (it is a good idea)
* and other audio parameters, you can create an audio object yourself and then
* give that to the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet. Note that you should NOT free this object.
* The ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet takes ownership of this pointer.
* \code
* ResourcePolicy::AudioResource*audioResource = new ResourcePolicy::AudioResource("player");
* mySet->addResourceObject(audioResource);
* \endcode
* Calling the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::deleteResource() method will remove
* and delete the object. Then when you want to acquire the modified ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet
* you simply use the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::acquire() method, like this:
* \code
* QObject::connect(mySet, SIGNAL(resourcesGranted(QList<ResourcePolicy::ResourceType>)), this, SLOT(acquireOkHandler(QList<ResourcePolicy::Resource>)));
* QObject::connect(mySet, SIGNAL(resourcesDenied()), this, SLOT(acquireDeniedHandler()));
* mySet->acquire();
* \endcode
* You should also connect to the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::lostResources() signal like this:
* \code
* QObject::connect(mySet, SIGNAL(lostResources()), this, SLOT(lostResourcesHandler()));
* \endcode
* This signal tells you when you should stop using the resources you have asked for.
* So it is important that you connect to it.
*
* To modify the properties of the resources you can use the ResourcePolicy::ResourceSet::resource() method.
*
